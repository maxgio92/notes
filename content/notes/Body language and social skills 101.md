title: Body language and social skills 101
---

- No fake smiles
- Be authentic
- Say hi / ask about themselves
- When talking take the right distance, which are different if you want to be closer than just demonstrating you're listening
- When talking, look at their eyes at least at the end of the sentence, not the opposite
- Mh mh / yes I'm listening and focused on what you're saying - not too frequently
- Connections levels up after discovering/asking about how they see themselves - it can surprise you how they live and feel themselves
- not too much leaning
- non verbal bridge - like closing distance in closer zone but not intimate zone
- hand shaking / hugging: if ppl say good to see you from distance they probably don't want to go further
- speech: start from the center, categorize parts of the speech going left and right
- move arms away from your torso
- distance between lobs and shoulders / shoulders down
- head tilt
- speak louder
- don't overthink how to start a conversation / be basic - hey I'm x nice to meet u / ask like plans
- think out of the box / there are many ways to be social / ask better questions
