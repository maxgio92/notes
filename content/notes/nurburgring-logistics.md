I visited Nordschleife this Sunday for the tourist track day. I walked some parts of the circuit and took plenty of photos. I decided to make this map to help you navigate it. I didn't manage to cover the entire track in 1 day as it's a lot of walking and I had to stop and take photos and videos at certain locations.

Areas marked with red are not accessible by the general public due to safety concerns. Only accredited photographers are allowed in those areas.

If you want to see the first section with the corners then I recommend parking at "Parkplatz Quiddelbacher HÃ¶he", [Google Maps link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XBTVfzWZLTuzZvoq6), and then walk backwards.

From here on I do not recommend walking ahead, instead take the car to the next parking location. The parking location is exactly at Adenauer Forst, [Google Maps link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ujh1b5SsgtQyfPCm9). You can access this parking by following the road from [Schulparkplatz](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XNGKB69WrXYV1dCd7). Near this parking, you will see the road that leads to the Adenauer Forst parking. The road has a forbidden entry board, but you can ignore it and drive all the way to Adenauer Forst. Plenty of people there.

From here on, you can choose to go backward toward Aremberg if you want to see the cars from up close and take some nice photos. Just cross the bridge at Aremberg to get to the inside of this corner.

Next up there's a tiny parking spot on the side of the road right under the circuit [Google Maps link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QYr8qEnGKdXRFLp28). It's near the popular [Bistro Cockpit](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GdRxzYetyjCMM9Lr7). There is a [Lidl](https://maps.app.goo.gl/irCKijRDuMkMhtrB9) like 100m north of the circuit, perhaps it's better to park there and walk to the circuit. So as you walk up the stairs to the circuit you will end up at Breidscheid/Ex-Muhle.
From here I recommend walking backward to Wehrseifen. Great spot for spectating and taking pictures.

Next up, take the car and drive to Brunnchen parking [Google Maps link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iLNHbEvJJZYDTxTs6). Plenty of people here in this parking. You can go forward to the outside of Brunnchen, also known as the "Youtube corner" as there are plenty of Youtube videos shot from that spot.
Alternatively, you can walk backward and go to Karussell.

Next time I will try to cover the rest of the circuit and try to find new parking spots and walking paths.

TLDR/Summary:

In short, if you don't want to walk a lot and want to enjoy some good spots:

Quiddelbacher Hohe Parking then walk backward

Adenauer Forst Parking (+ optionally walk backward to Aremberg)

Breidscheid/Ex-Muhle Parking (or Lidl parking nearby) and walk backward to Wehrseifen

Brunnchen Parking (a.k.a. Youtube corner) + walk backward to Karussell.
